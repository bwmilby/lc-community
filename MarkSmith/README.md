# Mark Smith Collection

Mark Smith's revolution libraries are currently available here:
http://marksmith.on-rev.com/revstuff/

The page actually redirects to a [Web Ring](http://www.webring.org/l/rd?ring=runtimerevoluti1;id=15;url=http%3A%2F%2Fmarksmith%2Eon-rev%2Ecom%2Frevstuff%2F) page.

Zip files can also be downloaded from
http://www.pdslabs.net/the-mark-smith-collection/


There are a few dead links on the main page:
1. libID3.zip
1. IPtoCountry.zip
1. audiofileinfo.zip

If anyone has a copy of these stacks, contact me and I'll include them in 
this repository.


The initial commit is the raw code from the downloaded archives.  Updates
will be posted that remove incompatibilities the exist with later versions
of LiveCode (such as the native sha1digest function).


All stacks are run through 
[Script Tracker](http://livecodeshare.runrev.com/stack/874/Script-Tracker)
which allows the scripts to be viewable directly online at GitHub.
